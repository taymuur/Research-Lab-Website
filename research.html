                           <p>
                              It was a funded project by National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), 
                              Islamabad. The project funding is Rs 0.48 M. The objective of the project MUSTAED 
                              is to develop cost effective Intrusion Detection System for shore installation 
                              utilizing expertise held within Pakistan and using commercial off-the-shelf 
                              available hardware. MUSTAED V1.0 has been developed and the first working model 
                              was installed on site in August 2011. The system was developed using a cost-
                              effective vibration sensor. Lab trials and tests were conducted following 
                              “Site Acceptance Trials”. In light of the observations recorded, required 
                              modifications were incorporated in the system design and MUSTAED v2.0 was 
                              developed for better false alarm rate with lower cost effects.

                              One of the many areas in which the lab is striving to gain excellence is 
                              local development of security systems. Development of face recognition under 
                              constrained software under constrained environment was one of such application. 
                              The first phase of the project has been completed. The developed software is 
                              capable of recognizing video stream images from a database of 40 images. Efforts 
                              are in hand to enhance working capability and efficiency of the software.

                              Diesel generators have rapidly become an essential part of our country mate’s life, 
                              unfortunately due to the existing prolonged electricity crisis. They provide 
                              services in all sectors of our daily life. Out of the spectrum of the present 
                              energy crisis, generators are also used for a wide variety of requirements. A 
                              large number are used by civil and military organizations wherever portability is 
                              required.  Generators provide power to electric appliances which are used in 
                              abundance in all fields of life. Fault free, reliable and safe operation is one of 
                              the most desired aspects required by all users. For continued operation of 
                              generators, regular maintenance is carried out. Generally Planned Maintenance 
                              Schedule (PMS) is performed. PMS compromises maximum useful life and tries to 
                              ensure safe operation. On the contrary, condition based maintenance (CBM) approach 
                              tries to maximize useful life of equipment without compromising safe operation 
                              limits. In this approach, samples of different signals are collected and based on 
                              the information extracted from them, deterioration or otherwise in the equipment 
                              is estimated. Under the proposed research we will develop a methodology for 
                              detection and classification of fault in generator sets which are commonly in 
                              service in domestic and industrial applications

                              Health state of all the equipment which moves or possess moving parts can be 
                              assessed by measuring vibration in the system. If the vibration level increases, 
                              it indicates that some part of the equipment is being damaged. Vibration data 
                              needs to be collected and is to be analyzed in the time, frequency and/or time 
                              frequency domain to detect the abnormality. The vibration measurements are 
                              collected using a VA test set. These sets are not produced locally and are 
                              imported for large foreign exchange. The project covers engineering aspects of

                              The aim of the project is to provide a cost-effective and feasible solution for 
                              automating the lifting and transport processes of heavy current transformers inside the company’s 
                              manufacturing facility.

                              Along with innovation, the project enables applied research comprising mechanical 
                              and electrical aspects. The solution proposed is an autonomous system to lift the 
                              transformers from ground level onto a motorized rover system capable of manoeuvring 
                              and transport the current transformers from the storage area to the assembly area.
                              This will greatly mitigate the health and safety hazards and reduce worker 
                              fatigue and also increase the productivity of technicians. Process automation makes 
                              the work environment more ergonomically feasible and frees up time for the technician 
                              to carry out other tasks that require a greater level of human consideration. 
                              Robots and machines surpass the abilities of the human workforce in terms of speed,

                              and fabricated which includes a vision-guided Selective Compliance Articulated 
                              Robot Arm (SCARA) for lifting heavy loads and the Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) 
                              for transporting goods inside an industrial facility. The prototype design stage 
                              comprised 3D modelling and joint torque analysis through CAD software, dynamic and 
                              part calculations analyzed using standard mechanical formulas. Moreover, control 
                              automation and computer vision algorithms were implemented for autonomous 
                              positioning, obstacle avoidance and grappling applications.

                              the fitness of transformers primarily based totally on DGA results. Along with 
                              being an essential part of the distribution and transmission network, 
                              transformers also are very expensive, as is the price of energy interruption.

                              The energy distribution businesses around the world are displaying 
                              extraordinary hobby in fitness tracking of transformers due to the fact 
                              fitness tracking can robustness, authenticity, providence, manufacturing

                              project, a device is being advanced that is capable of replicating the 
                              fitness of a transformer all through its operation the use of non-intrusive 
                              parameters, in order engineers can take right preventive measures earlier 
                              than minor troubles grow to be fundamental faults. Further, the signal 
                              processing and machine learning techniques are to be implemented in FPGA 
                              which later will be a complete autonomous device for this complete setup. 
                              In future, it is strictly advised to do so for the sake of reduced complexity, 
                              circuit size and requirement of extra equipment. For future aspects, it is 
                              advised that a deep and thorough learning of concepts of FPGA, principal 
                              component analysis (PCA), signal processing and communication networks is 
                              required in order to further move the current working. All these aspects are 
                              integrated in one place that gives a clear picture of what real-time and

                              Our autonomous firefighting drone can help the industrial sector to establish 
                              safety protocols in order to secure their premises by monitoring the area 
                              and performing tasks to attend to pervasive fire hazards that can have adverse 
                              effects on people’s health and properties.
                           </p>

                              When a fire breaks out, the first few minutes are crucial, and first responders 
                              must arrive promptly to assess the situation and take action before the fire 
                              spreads. In an autonomous fire-fighting UAV-based rescue, our UAV will operate  
                              as the first response on the site. Its timely response will make the area safer. 
                              As soon as in-building sensors detect a fire, the UAV is deployed and flies to 
                              the spot, inspecting the area for fire. The UAV will also have fire recognition 
                              skills, as well as the ability to drop fire extinguisher balls, enclosed in a 
                              lightweight container actuated with the servo. UAV combined with firefighting 
                              will make it easier to access and control fire outbreak before it spreads, 
                              minimizing the harm. The UAV is a safer and more reliable response to fire 
                              threats and outbreaks because it can cover wider regions and is not fueled by 
                              instincts or emotions.

                              Smart meter technology has revolutionized the power management infrastructure in 
                              the world. However, problems such as line theft and high cost of production are 
                              still prevalent. There is a need to establish a robust infrastructure through 
                              which power management can be done more efficiently. This report presents a 
                              possible solution to issues such as the ability to automatically and remotely 
                              measure energy usage, detect tampering, monitor power quality, and allow for 
                              superior functionality in terms of data communication, metering and control.

                              AMI is associated with the entire metering facility and the "smart meter" 
                              in this infrastructure is the popular metering device. In this infrastructure, 
                              the term "smart" makes sense, meaning that the meter can process data (voltage 
                              and current) to convert them into useful output information (e.g., energy 
                              consumption, power quality indicators, efficiency, and others). But the concept 
                              of "smart" is not usually defined because many smart meters have no intelligent 
                              functionality on the market. There is a present demand for innovative and smart 
                              techniques to give utilities and consumers various kinds of information about 
                              their energy consumption, efficiency and costs and therefore better management 
                              of energy. Researchers worldwide are therefore proposing new tools, new methods, 
                              and innovative ways of saving energy, to provide further information about 
                              energy consumption.

                              Driver’s attentiveness and responsiveness is a critical measure to guarantee 
                              a safe environment  on the road. The major reason for accidents on the road 
                              are drivers’ drowsy and fatigue state which  contribute to huge numbers of 
                              fatalities and injuries globally. An automated system designed  to detect the 
                              drowsiness state of the driver and alert him afterwards has a capacity to 
                              remarkably  reduce accidents. Intrusive methods require a physical contact 
                              with the drivers to measure their  physiological signals for the signs of 
                              drowsiness and previously had comparatively been more  accurate in detection.
                              The methodology which we have implemented has eliminated the  requirement of 
                              being in constant contact with the driver and provides us with even more  
                              accuracy due to the utilization of an efficient approach of computer vision 
                              and machine learning.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              In this project we have developed a mobile platform based driver monitoring 
                              and safety system. We have incorporated recent developments that have happened 
                              in the field of embedded systems which enables them to handle complex computation 
                              and do heavy processing. This allows us to implement machine learning models on 
                              small, inexpensive, and powerful standalone systems. In previous solutions for 
                              drowsiness detection the approach employs individual techniques which when 
                              implemented alone presents practical limitations. Considering this aspect, we in
                              our proposed solution are using above individual techniques in conjunction 
                              or hybrid manner but keeping intact the non-intrusive nature of our project. 
                              The techniques we are implementing have no such external or environmental 
                              factors which can impact the performance of drowsiness detection systems. 
                              Our system has no cables requiring physical contact with the driver which in 
                              result does not restrict the driver’s movement.

                              Peer to Peer Energy Trading, commonly referred to as P2P energy trading, 
                              is an emerging phenomenon due to the increasing demand in electricity 
                              supply and the change in energy supply patterns and technology. As 
                              conventional methods of electricity production and supply have been 
                              incompetent, newer methods have made its way into the global market. 
                              Most notably, two way transfer of energy in the electricity network and 
                              independent generation of energy by households. This report proposes a 
                              method to employ P2P energy trading within a micro-grid comprising of six 
                              houses. A smart bi-directional smart meter designing is discussed along with 
                              a GUI comprising of Individual Data Monitor for each house for power 
                              agreement between producer and consumer. A Central Power Monitor GUI is also 
                              designed to keep track of each consumer’s consumption of energy and producer’s, 
                              production of energy taking part in P2P energy trading system. A database is 
                              also created to keep past record of data, as well as of present real-time 
                              values are also fed to the system.

                              The main aim of this project is to provide energy in a decentralized network 
                              in affordable prices. The energy involved in this project is produced using 
                              renewable resources which helps in eradicating greenhouse effect. This also 
                              ensures that carbonization is minimized and people from rural as well as from 
                              hilly areas are provided with basic necessity of clean electricity in a 
                              secure manner. The first step of this project includes designing of a smart 
                              meter which is able to read all the essential electrical parameters and track 
                              the direction of flow of electricity in both directions. Second step involves, 
                              designing of graphical user interface comprising of Individual Data Monitor 
                              and Central Server Monitor. Central Server Monitor is used to track the 
                              electric parameters of the house that is connected to it while Central Server 
                              Monitor keeps track of all the data of the house connected in the P2P network. 
                              Finally, the interfacing between the smart meter and the GUIs.

                              In the generation of ever-increasing demand for higher efficiency and reduced 
                              human labor in day-to-day as well as industrial tasks, the focus has veered 
                              magnanimously toward robotics. According to International Federation of Robotics 
                              (IFR) report of 2020, global population of industrial robots has leaped to 
                              2.7 million, which is 12% increase as compared to last year. One such example 
                              of an industrial task that demands increased efficiency is the manual material 
                              handling within industry by labor, which places constraints on costs, human energy 
                              and speed of packaging. The project focuses on using a Selective Compliance 
                              Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA) as an effective alternative to manual material 
                              handling procedures, hence introducing automation in the industry. This implies 
                              that instead of continuing with the current execution methods by hand and the 
                              equivalent transportation of materials via a conveyer belt, a robotic equivalent 
                              of a human arm be designed and fabricated resulting in higher levels of efficiency 
                              in terms of reduced human error, human energy and labor costs, and an increased 
                              packaging rate, throughput and manufacturing productivity.

                              The aim was to design and fabricate a four-degree-of-freedom robotic arm with an 
                              end-effector that can be employed to pick and place finished and unfinished 
                              products manufactured in the industry. It uses a Arduino microcontroller board to 
                              instruct the robot arm, which can successfully complete the task of picking a series  
                              of products one at a time from a conveyor belt and placing them away according to a 
                              pre-programmed sequence. Moreover, this project can improve the industry's current 
                              material handling technique by introducing low-cost automation.
